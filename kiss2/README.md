This software lets you use an arduino as an interface between a Linux system and some radio.
In the example code (mkiss.ino) I use the "RadioHead"-libray to use a LoRa radio to transmit AX.25 over.
Should also work with e.g. the RFM69HW or any other radio.

Required steps:
add a line to /etc/ax25/axports:

ax0	CALLSGN	9600	254	1	AX.25 over LoRa

ax0 is the interface name, CALLSGN is an AX.25 call-sign, 9600 is the speed to use when talking to the arduino and 254 is the maximum packet size that the radio can handle.

Then invoke:
kissattach /dev/ttyUSB0 ax0

This will connect /dev/ttyUSB0 (the serial device to which the Arduino is connected) to the network interface called ax0 (see axports).
In Debian the kissattach software can be found in the ax25-tools package.
